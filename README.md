## Overview Of Research

I am currently a 6th year PhD candidate working with Dr. James Aguirre on Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA). HERA is a second generation radio telescope dedicated to observing large scale structure during and prior to the epoch of reionization of the universe.

My thesis topic will focus on developing software for a more robust calibration and imaging pipeline for the research. I am also building a deep 2D convolutional neural network to regress cosmological parameters. These results will be heavily scrutinized through validations tests ensuring that it is a statistically sound prediction.

## Research Topics

In the **images** directory are images of different results. For now, they are not grouped in any order.

In the **ML** (Machine Learning) directory are both python script and jupyter notebooks of regression of cosomological parameter *tau*, the optical depth. The directory also includes different hypeparameter optimization techniques.

In the **plimpy** (PoLarized IMaging in PYthon) directory includes a range of topics that address validation techniques used to validate a portion of the calibration HERA pipeline. It also has scripts/notebooks on making frequency dependent Mueller beams using Zachary Martinot and Nicolas Fagnoni scripts and models. Finally, I have scripts that use CASA (Common Astronomy Software Application) to do antenna based calibration on HERA data.
